Student is Driving Me Crazy!!</b></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If you are a
teacher, most likely, along the way, there has been a student that
has driven you crazy!  Maybe you have multiple each year?  This
student pushes every one of your buttons!  He/she is never absent,
late or leaves early, and they never leave for a week trip to Disney!
 <font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>*For the sake of this
article, let&rsquo;s talk about, what schools refer to, as a &ldquo;typical
developing student&rdquo;, instead of students that exhibit extreme
violent behavior. I will address those experiences in another
article.  </i></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Usually, teachers
will react two different ways when dealing with this type of student.
 One, they may feel it would make them look bad to admit they have
strong, negative feelings about a student, especially in the lower
grades.  It seems to be more socially acceptable to think that
teenagers are <i>supposed</i> to drive you crazy!?  Some may have the
belief that good teachers should never dislike any of their students.
 Therefore, those feelings make us feel guilty!  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Second, some may
talk about this student, in &lsquo;acceptable&rsquo; teacher terms
like, &lsquo;they are lacking in social skills, or they do not have
any motivation or initiative (for a multiple of reasons we explore),
or their parents did not teach them any manners,&rdquo; etc.  
Whatever we use to justify our feelings of frustration, it is totally
about them, not us!  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The first reaction,
is riddled with guilt that we are not good enough and the second
reaction says our student is not good enough.  In reality, we usually
have a combo of both reactions.  However, after many years of
teaching, I began to question these thoughts.  In other words, I
began to wonder what my frustration about my student was really
about.  Was it that I was horrible person?  Was this student really
that horrible?  Or was there something deeper going on?  Was this
more about me?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><a name="_GoBack"></a>
I concluded that all of the &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; justifications
were really just distractions; distractions from looking deeper
within myself!   Even the guilt was a distraction.  Guilt gets us
nowhere; it just simply makes us feel bad about who we are and
prevents us from moving on to what really matters; educating children
at the highest level.  I have never met a teacher, riddled with guilt
of any kind, who was effective in the classroom.  Guilt literally
says, stop, you are not good enough to move on.  You are not good
enough to be forgiven.  You are not good enough to gain wisdom from
this experience.  Guilt literally blocks our true self shining
through and our students only get half of a teacher.  The other half
is busy telling him/her why they stink! 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Next we look at the
student.  All of those reasons we came up with why they are so &ldquo;bad&rdquo;
or wrong and causing a problem in our life.  Many of those statements
may be a fact about our student.  But, I always felt like facts were
unemotional!  So, why did these facts stir up negative feelings? 
Well, the truth is, it is easier to see in others what we do not like
in ourselves.  Sometimes, our student is reflecting back to us
something we do not like about ourselves.  An example:  Our student
is quick to judge?  Am I quick to judge?  Other times, a student can
remind us (unconsciously at first) of someone that hurt us deeply. 
Are these emotions that rose to the surface, really a part of
ourselves that have not been healed?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It seems, those
students that drive us crazy, represent something deeper about us! 
They are teaching us about ourselves.   If we examine more closely
the emotions they stir in us, we realize we have been given an
amazing opportunity to learn more about ourselves.  Almost as soon as
we see the mirror, we begin to see that student in a different light;
as OUR teacher!
