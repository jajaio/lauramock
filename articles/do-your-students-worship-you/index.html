I am not a fan of categories, but for the sake of this article, I am going to 
make some generalizations. &nbsp;Let's say there are two types of students.
&nbsp;One group of students who have supportive, loving homes. &nbsp;The other 
group either have inconsistent support and/or basically, little to no nurturing
at home. &nbsp;&nbsp;Whether this lack of unconditional love was the result of
trauma or some kind of dysfunction within the family unit, simply put, it has
not been an easy road for this child or young adult. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

The second group are your students that either display signs that they are 
desperate for your love and attention, OR, they have shut down their heart 
and appear cold. &nbsp;Either way, if you are a teacher that is in touch with 
your students, you will recognize these signs quickly. At that point, many of 
us give them what they do not have. Nurturing love. &nbsp;It feels like our 
calling to love all of our children, especially those that come from broken 
places. So, we jump right in and begin to love that child back to life. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

What happens next, is extremely predictable and understandable! &nbsp;It will 
not be long before your student begins to see you as a GOD. &nbsp;When we are so
thirsty, we will drink whatever is offered to us because we are desperate to
find relief. &nbsp;So, the moment this student lets you into their heart, the
worship factor begins. &nbsp;Can you imagine never having someone look at you
with love in their eyes; or if you have never had your voice and presence in
this world valued? &nbsp;So of course, the moment someone *genuinely cares for
you, you want to cling to them with your life. &nbsp;It feels good to be
authentically loved. &nbsp;We all know this is true.</span></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

As a teacher, this can be both wonderful experience and a slippery slope. &nbsp;The
wonderful part is quite obvious. &nbsp;You have accomplished your goal of
reaching your student, on a heart level. &nbsp;They know you love and care for
them and it feels so good! &nbsp;But, here is the slope: &nbsp;when a student
worships you to an extreme, they are externalizing love and not internalizing
it. &nbsp;A student can genuinely love you, respect you and look up to you as
their mentor without making you into a God. &nbsp;But, the students who have
been starved of this attention, can easily swing to the other extreme.</span></span></p>

So now, at this very point, YOU have the opportunity to make an incredibly positive
impact. &nbsp;Consider sitting with this child, one-on-one. &nbsp;Acknowledge
how much you love and value them. &nbsp;Then, ask them, what does it feel like
when you hear me say that in your body? &nbsp;Most students, depending on their
age, will say something like they are receiving a warm hug without anyone
touching them. &nbsp;Then consider sharing, in age-appropriate terms, that the
warm hug they feel has always been there, inside of them their whole life!
&nbsp;It had just been lost and it was an honor to help them find it again.
&nbsp;The secret is, if you feel love from me and love towards me, that it must
mean, it was already there inside of you! &nbsp;Otherwise, it would have been
unrecognizable to you. &nbsp;&nbsp;It may feel like I put it there or it is
because of me that you feel this hug. &nbsp;Gently say, that hug you feel
from me is actually YOU. &nbsp;I just happen to notice you had lost it; because
I love myself, I can feel it when someone else does not. &nbsp;All I did was to
help you bring back a part of you that was missing or blocked. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='white-space:pre-wrap'><span

As a teacher, when we do this, we are holding up a mirror and reminding our student
who they really are...lovable, valuable and worth it! &nbsp;The goal is for the
student to realize that are worthy of being purely loved, just because they
were born. &nbsp;Holding up the mirror is literally shifting perceptions from
external to internal; from overidentification of you, to an internal love of
themselves. &nbsp;This is a feeling they can access at any time, without our
presence. &nbsp;This will hopefully plant a seed, in the child, of internal
empowerment. &nbsp;The real joy is loving yourself. &nbsp;When this happens,
our cup is full and we can share that love in a healthy and authentic manner. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

Your students will respect you more, in the long run, for helping them find that
lost piece of themselves. &nbsp;My gut also tells me they will pay it forward,
just like you do, every day in your classroom! &nbsp;What could be more
powerful than that?</span></span></p>
