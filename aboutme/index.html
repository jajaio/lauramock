							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p><strong>Revolutionary Teaching, Evolutionary Living:</strong> Rising above the mundane and the status quo to a higher

essence of being.

I have always been intrigued by others searching for deeper meaning within their own existence. “Why

are we here?” Who are were we really, before the outside world influenced us and we brought into

society’s definition of ourselves.

I am not the first to speak of these ideas by any means. I am simply providing another avenue to

transform thought. However, I am drawn to the practical. I have been seeking out and examining

everyday life as opportunities to grow. Therefore, I have learned when working with one’s thoughts and

deep seeded beliefs, it can bring tremendous healing and insights. Those events or people that cause

pain, joy, annoyance or peace are truly our best teachers.

My first insight into this came while working with children. Being in a school setting as a 4 th and 5 th

grade teacher for many years, I was especially humbled to see how the adults in their “world”, including

teachers, influenced their self-image. Underneath this influence and their own personality traits, I

could always see their “true-self”, even when they had forgotten. I have never met a child who was not

beautiful, and had a unique set of gifts. This was not to say that they did not have challenges.

However, underneath it all was their amazing soul. I watched them own it, forget it and fight it. No

matter if I was in rural, suburban, or inner city school, I witnessed how their belief system about

themselves and the world, influenced their choices. I watched how those choices created either joy,

peace, fear or distrust.

I explored this even deeper, as a director of a school. I was able to learn about the family unit and how

they were all connected. I watched the extreme contrast of emotions that arose when “raising” another

human being. Again, I could see (even though adults typically have more walls than children), each

adult’s true essence and beautiful spirit, underneath their words and actions. I could see how their

belief systems and their truths about themselves influenced how they saw the world, especially, in

relation to their child.

All of which, I soon discovered, were excellent case studies! However, the best case study of all was Me.

Beside my own career, I also fulfill the roles of wife, mother of two boys, daughter, sister and a friend.

My life was my best teacher. Everything I learned from my own children, husband, parents, my

students, their parents, and my peers, helped me to better understand my own experiences which

evolved my thinking. I was able to look in the mirror more deeply and ask, “When I am mad at so –n-so,

what are they triggering in me that is not healed? When do I make decisions out of fear? Do I have a

belief that needs to be explored deeper that is causing me pain? Is that belief the truth or something

someone told me was truth?” etc.

All of these experiences brought me to an informal and formal study of spirituality, which I interpret as

the study of “ourselves”, and “our truth”. It is a detailed study and at times, a philosophical exploration

of the human experience. I became fascinated by how we came to be the person we are today, as I am

always searching for a deeper truth and meaning behind everyday life. Due to my connection to

spirituality, I have studied these concepts by the way of reading many books, asking questions of others

on a similar path, attending workshops/classes, conducting small group book studies, intentional

journaling and learning the power of silence, etc. Eventually, I was lead to Emerson Theological

Institute, which I am currently working towards a Master’s in Spiritual Studies. All of which has given me

much joy and peace in my life!

Therefore, this concept of Revolutionary Teaching, Evolutionary Living was born. I feel we are all

students and teachers throughout our life. Formally and/or informally. We are the leader of our life! It

has become my passion to hold the space and introduce the wisdom that has been passed down for

generations, to others that are seeking more! I enjoy working with those looking for more fulfillment,

value, truth, peace. Especially those feeling like there has to be more to life than what they are

experiencing now. It is my intent to help facilitate a revolution the way one teaches, leads, work with

others, or just simply, experience daily life. I feel the lens to which one interprets life, will evolve into a

deeper and more fulfilling existence.</p>
