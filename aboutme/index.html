							<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Rising above the mundane and the status quo to a higher deeper and more fulfilling existence:</i></p>
					
<p>I have always been intrigued by the process of searching for deeper meaning within our existence.

 Questions like, “Why are we here?”  Who were we before the outside world influenced us?” I am not

the first to ask or even to ponder these ideas by any means.  Lucky me!  Thank goodness there were

(and still are) so many ahead of me on this path, that so lovingly and openly shared their knowledge,

wisdom and what I refer to as the ‘Secrets to Life’. Therefore, I became a seeker of this work; I literally

absorbed myself in this world of self-realization.</p>  

<p>Through various studies and, life experiences, I was grateful to finally realize that I had all the answers!

What?  This was initially something I did not want to hear!  I am a very good listener and list checker, so

this was scary at first. After some time, I agreed to release my fear and embraced the idea that the

answers lay inside of me! I learned by embracing powerful, ancient wisdom and pairing it with

everyday life experiences, I found freedom; freedom from being a prisoner of my own mind! The lens to

which I viewed life turned upside down, in a good way! I concluded that all we seem to need was a

fresh perspective and our life provided us ample opportunities to grow, love and live a fulfilled life!</p>  

<p>That fresh perspective was about being open to this ancient wisdom that truly, is all around us, all the

time, when we open our eyes and our hearts. As I went through this process, of understanding this

wisdom and seeing it work through my own life, I learned our thoughts and our beliefs held the power

of joy or misery. If we are willing to examine our thoughts and deep seeded beliefs more closely, it can

bring tremendous insights and healing. In other words, the events or people that cause pain, joy,

annoyance or peace, are truly our best teachers.</p>  

<strong>My Journey:</strong>

<p>One of my first insights of understanding the deeper meaning of life, came while working with children.

 Being in a school setting as a 4 th and 5 th grade teacher for many years, I was especially humbled to see

how adults in their “world”, including teachers, influenced their beliefs about themselves, whether they

were actually true or not.   However, as I looked deeper, underneath this influence and the child’s own

personality, their true-self was always present, even if they had forgotten.  Without a doubt, all children

are beautiful, and have a unique set of gifts.  Of course, human life can present, what we interpret as

challenges, and some children had more than others.  But, ever present, was their light, even if I had to

strain to see it at times!  I watched them own their light, forget it and fight it.  It did not seem to matter

if I was in rural, suburban, or inner city school, I witnessed how their belief system about themselves and

the world, influenced their emotions, and subsequently, their choices.  I watched how those choices

created either joy, peace, fear or distrust.</p>   

<p>As I reflected on my experiences, I realized, that these students were my mirrors.  I too, at times, owned

my light, forgot it, fought it and strained to see it.  I too could see how my thoughts and belief systems

influence my happiness.  I wondered if my thoughts were really mine, or where they my parents, teachers

or others?  I began to seek more!</p>

<p>Just as ‘life’ always seems to know what we ‘need’ next, I eventually became a director of a school. My

focus, as a teacher, was mainly my students. But of course, parents and peers were very important as a

teacher. Now, as a director, this job was still focused on the student. However, the focus of the whole

unit, which included staff and parents, was amplified. Looking through the eyes of a ‘boss’, I would

notice a variety of emotions: some of balance and positive self-worth, some of being hard on

themselves or not feeling good enough, or the need for control. Each of which, I have experienced in

my own life and could better learn about myself sometimes, through the experience of others.

   Regarding parents, this job gave me an excellent seat to witness the extreme contrast of emotions that

arose when “raising” another human being, through a parent’s eye.  I could see (even though adults

typically have more walls than children), each adult’s true essence and beautiful spirit, underneath their

words and actions. I could see how their belief systems and their truths about themselves influenced

how they saw the world, especially, in relation to their child. Again, more mirrors popped up as I could

also get lost in the worry about my own children at times; wanting to have more control out of fear of

‘what if’’.</p>   

<p>These experiences and other family experiences, brought me to a deeper level of awareness

within myself and others. It brought me to a place of love and acceptance. If I find, what I

perceive as struggle, I go inward and ask, “What do I need to remember or notice about myself?”

If I still need more support, I will reach out to my family, friends or advisors and ask them to help me

see what I am missing. Currently, I have expanded this circle of support and growth, as I am pursuing a

Master’s in Spiritual Studies at Emerson Theological Institute. Again, all of which take me deeper on the

journey of awareness and understanding!</p>

<p>Therefore, this concept of Revolutionary Teaching, Evolutionary Living was born. I feel we are all

students and teachers throughout our life, formally and informally. We are the leader of our life!  It is

my passion to hold the space and introduce the wisdom that has been passed down for generations, to

others that are seeking more! I enjoy working with those looking for more fulfillment, value, truth, and

peace; those feeling like there must be more to life than what they are experiencing now. It is my intent

to help facilitate a revolution in the way one teaches, leads, work with others, parent children, or just

simply and importantly, joyfully experiences daily life!</p>
